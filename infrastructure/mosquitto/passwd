# MQTT User Authentication File
# =============================
# 
# This file contains username:password pairs for MQTT authentication
# Passwords should be hashed using mosquitto_passwd utility
#
# Usage: mosquitto_passwd -c passwd username
# 
# Example users (passwords need to be generated):
# Replace these with actual hashed passwords

# IoT Device User
iot_user:$7$101$abc123def456$hash_here

# Admin User  
admin:$7$101$xyz789uvw012$hash_here

# Service User for Internal Services
service:$7$101$mno345pqr678$hash_here

# Application User
app_user:$7$101$stu901vwx234$hash_here

# Note: To generate actual password hashes, run:
# mosquitto_passwd -c passwd iot_user
# mosquitto_passwd passwd admin
# mosquitto_passwd passwd service
# mosquitto_passwd passwd app_user
#
# This will prompt for passwords and generate the proper hashes
