# Screenshot Placeholder Files

This directory contains placeholder files for screenshots that need to be captured.

## Current Status: Placeholder Images

The following placeholder files are created to prevent broken links in the README:

1. `dashboard.png` - Dashboard screenshot placeholder
2. `analytics.png` - Analytics screenshot placeholder  
3. `devices.png` - Devices screenshot placeholder
4. `login.png` - Login screenshot placeholder
5. `api-docs.png` - API documentation screenshot placeholder
6. `grafana.png` - Grafana screenshot placeholder

## To Replace Placeholders:

1. Navigate to the respective URL (system is running)
2. Capture a high-quality screenshot (1920x1080 recommended)
3. Save with the exact filename shown above
4. Replace the placeholder file in this directory
5. Commit and push the changes

## System URLs for Screenshots:

- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- Analytics: http://localhost:3000/analytics
- Devices: http://localhost:3000/devices
- Login: http://localhost:3000/login
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)

The README will automatically show the actual screenshots once the image files are replaced.
