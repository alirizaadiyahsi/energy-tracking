## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tickets

### Ticket #1: Backend - Data Ingestion Service Device CRUD Endpoints
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

**Description:**
Implement missing device CRUD endpoints in the data-ingestion service to match the frontend API calls.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add POST /api/v1/devices endpoint for device creation
- [ ] Add PUT /api/v1/devices/{device_id} endpoint for device updates  
- [ ] Add DELETE /api/v1/devices/{device_id} endpoint for device deletion
- [ ] Implement proper request/response models
- [ ] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] Add permission checking integration
- [ ] Add database operations for device persistence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All device CRUD operations work through the API gateway
- Proper error responses and validation
- Integration with authentication and authorization
- Database persistence of device changes

### Ticket #2: Frontend - Device Management UI Integration
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Description:**
Connect existing device form components to the main Devices page and implement proper state management.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add modal state management to Devices page
- [ ] Connect "Add Device" button to DeviceModal
- [ ] Connect "Edit" buttons to DeviceModal with pre-filled data
- [ ] Implement device deletion with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Add proper error handling and success notifications
- [ ] Add loading states for all operations
- [ ] Integrate with React Query for cache invalidation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can add new devices through the UI
- Users can edit existing devices
- Users can delete devices with confirmation
- Proper feedback for all operations
- UI updates reflect changes immediately

### Ticket #3: Enhanced Device Form and Validation
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Description:**
Enhance the device form to match the backend API requirements and add proper validation.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update DeviceForm to include all required fields (type, location, power, voltage)
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for device creation/update
- [ ] Implement client-side validation
- [ ] Add device type selection dropdown
- [ ] Add form field validation feedback
- [ ] Handle different device types with appropriate fields

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Form matches backend API requirements
- Proper validation with user feedback
- Support for different device types
- Type-safe implementation

---

### Ticket #4: Device Management Permissions and Security
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Description:**
Implement proper permission checking for device operations in the backend.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add permission checks to device CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Implement organization-based access control
- [ ] Add audit logging for device operations
- [ ] Validate user permissions for device operations
- [ ] Add rate limiting for device operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only authorized users can perform device operations
- Organization isolation works correctly
- All device operations are audited
- Proper error messages for permission denials

---

### Ticket #5: Testing and Documentation
**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Description:**
Add comprehensive testing and documentation for device management functionality.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add unit tests for device CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests for device management flow
- [ ] Add frontend component tests
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add user documentation for device management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Updated documentation
- Working end-to-end tests
