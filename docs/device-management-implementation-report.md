## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Architecture

**Authentication Flow:**
```
Client Request â†’ JWT Validation â†’ User/Org Resolution â†’ Permission Check â†’ API Action â†’ Audit Log
```

**Permission Model:**
- Role-based access control (user, admin, super_admin)
- Organization-level device isolation
- Granular device permissions (READ, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Rate limiting per user role

**Audit Trail:**
- All device operations logged
- User identification and organization tracking
- Success/failure status recording
- Compliance with security requirements

### API Endpoints Implemented

| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Description |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/devices` | GET | READ_DEVICE | List devices with pagination |
| `/api/v1/devices` | POST | CREATE_DEVICE | Create new device |
| `/api/v1/devices/{id}` | GET | READ_DEVICE | Get device by ID |
| `/api/v1/devices/{id}` | PUT | UPDATE_DEVICE | Update device |
| `/api/v1/devices/{id}` | DELETE | DELETE_DEVICE | Delete device |

### Frontend Components

- **DeviceList**: Paginated device listing with filters
- **DeviceForm**: Create/edit device modal with validation
- **DeviceDetails**: Device information display
- **DeviceStatus**: Real-time status indicators

### Testing Coverage

**Backend Tests:**
- Unit tests: 434 lines covering all core functionality
- Integration tests: Workflow and end-to-end scenarios
- Security tests: Authentication and authorization
- Performance tests: Load and memory usage

**Frontend Tests:**
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- Form validation tests
- Error handling tests
